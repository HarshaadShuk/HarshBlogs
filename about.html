            <h1>About Harshaad Shukoor</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Harshaad Shukoor, currently a 2nd year integrated BS-MS student at The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata. Originally from Kerala, my upbringing has taken me across various parts of the country, shaping my perspective and aspirations.</p>
            <p>My academic journey is driven by a profound interest in science, particularly Mathematics and Physics. Theoretical physics, in particular, fascinates me as it allows me to explore abstract concepts and delve into the fundamental laws governing our universe.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I find joy in playing basketball, a sport that not only keeps me physically active but also fosters teamwork and camaraderie.</p>
            <p>Looking forward, I aspire to contribute to the field of theoretical physics, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding through research and theoretical advancements.</p>
